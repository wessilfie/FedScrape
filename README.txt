FedScrape
-----------------------
This program will allow the user to scrape a rule's date, title/action, federal register page number, CFR, RIN, and summary from the Federal Register (http://federalregister.gov) website.

To do this, the user must first use the advanced tools on the Federal Register website to find a list of relevant rules/actions. On the website, the user must use the browse feature to find the specific government agencies that they want data on. From there, use the search tool to only list rules from that agency. 






*------How to run this program-------------*
To run this program, you must first compile it. 
To do this, one must first 'cd'(place the file fedscrape into the desired folder) into the location where they would like the data to be saved and type "python fedscrape.py" After the file has been compiled, it should run as created at that point.
